## Navigating the UCI Interwebs

#### StudentAccess
This is probably gonna be the resource you'll use the most. Check on your current class schedule and your latest unofficial transcript. You can also print out your schedule from here so you don't have popup your phone after every class like a dumbass. Don't be like me.
Link: https://www.reg.uci.edu/access/student/studylist/?seg=U

#### DegreeWorks
See what classes you have left to take in order to graduate. I love whomever made this. It gives tells your current GPA. Cool beans.
Link: https://www.reg.uci.edu/dgw/IRISLink.cgi?seg=U

#### WebReg
Register or waitlist for classes. This motherfucking program likes to kick you out for no goddamn reason, so you have to login every 5 minutes. Keep this subtlety in mind when your registration window opens and you're rushing to register to classes. Again, don't be like me. Have your course codes ready.

#### Schedule of Classes
Only use this to check class specific information. Use Antplanner whenever possible for scheduling classes (see next section).
Link: https://www.reg.uci.edu/perl/WebSoc

#### Restriction codes
The UCI Catalogue will have these pesky little codes under the Rstr column. Be sure to check this while you're planning your course schedule. Otherwise, you could get royally screwed in the ass by major restricted classes.

## The Plan:tm:

#### Antplanner
Antplanner helps plan your schedule for the next quarter. It allows you to place classes down to find the best times for what you need.
Link: https://antplanner.appspot.com/
Click Load on the top of the page, type in zamorat, and press OK.
Don't forget to Save your schedule after changing it.

#### Make A Yearly Plan
I don't know about you, but I prefer to use Excel to plan out my entire 4-year long class schedule. Do this. This will allow you to gain a better understanding of what you need and when you need it by. Check off the following quarters when you've completed them on your own plan.
 [ ] Fall 2017
 [ ] Winter 2017
 [ ] Spring 2018
 [ ] Summer 2018
 [ ] Fall 2018
 [ ] Winter 2018
 [ ] Spring 2019
 > See DegreeWorks and the below resources for checking which classes you will need to take throughout your academic career at UCI.

## Requirements for your major

#### UCI Catalogue
Biological Sciences
Link: http://catalogue.uci.edu/schoolofbiologicalsciences/#schoolrequirementstext

#### Assist
There isn't too many major courses that transfer over, so no fuckery involved yet.

#### Transfer requirements
Doesn't look too bad. You only need to take the CHEM-1 series.

## General requirements

#### UCI Catalogue
Good luck peeling through this mystic, arcane spellbook. If I were you, I'd just look at DegreeWorks.
Link: http://catalogue.uci.edu/informationforadmittedstudents/requirementsforabachelorsdegree/

#### Assist
Check Assist to see which classes actually transferred. You're gonna need to grab a pooper-scooper and sit down with your counselor to get this shit sorted out. It'll take an hour on the first go. You're probably gonna have to go back and see another counselor to pick up any shit that the last counselor missed when he was scanning the lawn. It happens. Shit happens.
